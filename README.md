## P2-Cowboys Project
# Project Plan
-# Summary
-The project we are making is a website that allows users to search up tutorials on things that interest them or they would need help on for academic purposes. It is going to be built like Khan Academy, which is a website built to help students with specific classes for most grades, however our website will only focus on highschool junior year classes. You can find descriptions of classes and overviews in order to help the student find what they need. They can sign up on the website to reach more specific topics in the classes. It isnâ€™t going to be on such a scale as Khan Academy, but it should be able help students either way.
