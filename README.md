# Big Tickets

| Big Tickets                                | Assigned to | Explanation |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Ticket 1: Data from python to html         | Ethan Sun   |             |
| Ticket 2: Form and post                    | Luca Pinto  |  Created a login page where the user before entering the site needs to input a secret username and password in a form I created which would then send this information to the backend where it would be checked, and if correct the user could then continue to the main content of the website. In order to run/evaluate this code, the username is "admin" and password is "password". The user in the future will be able to signup which will change these two values, but for now these are the set values that will allow yoou to enter the main content. If entered wrong, the website will reload that page and ask you for the username and password again until you get it right, without getting these right the user will be unable to enter the rest of the website. Here is a link to my login code: https://github.com/EyJajb/tutorial_site/blob/ff459fd3215808760ec75e08ef78970cd6d1e917/diego's_tutorial_page/tutorial_site/templates/login.html#L1      |
| Ticket 3: Front end html work/organization | Diego Krenz |  I edited minor issues with the code. ie where ever there was a red ! I fixed what needed to be done. I also reorganized the tutorial pages to make them look better. One of the few template pages Diego edited: https://github.com/EyJajb/tutorial_site/blob/main/diego's_tutorial_page/tutorial_site/templates/Class.html            |
| Ticket 4: Equation/Logistical              | Naweid Hassanzadeh|

## Summary

-The project we are making is a website that allows users to search up tutorials on things that interest them or they would need help on for academic purposes.  It is going to be built like Khan Academy, which is a website built to help students with specific classes for most grades, however our website will only focus on highschool junior year classes. You can find descriptions of classes and overviews in order to help the student find what they need. They can sign up on the website to reach more specific topics in the classes. It isnâ€™t going to be on such a scale as Khan Academy, but it should be able help students either way.

## Delieverly plans and how we are going to do the big ticket items

-Every Week on monday we will set a goal for that week and we will have it done by thursday so that on friday we can make sure it works and also brainstorm what we intend to do the next week.  By the Mid Term mark we will have the basic part of the website done like all the pages with tutorials and videos, so that the rest of the trimester we can add the other harder requirements. Working hard in the beginning of the Trimester to get most of the project done will allow for us to work together and take our time to complete the harder or unfamiliar requirements like SQL and Internet Domain.  Then by N@M we will have a raspberry pi up so that we can share our project with others.

# Big ideas for AP
CB Big Idea #2 and #3. The technical requirements for Trimester 2 include coding in Python and extending Python beyond fundamentals and simple Web Site in trimester one.  Now students should consider advancing logic in system to use SQLArchemy database.  Big Ticket features should consider Backend Code to support routes, database requirements, data driven UI's, and filtering/searching/analyzing large quantities of data.
CB Big Idea #3.  UI design and presentation to user is a Big Ticket item.  Students have been instructed to create story boards to consider what the visuals will look like before they start to code.  HTML, CSS, and Java Script can be used in UI design.
Big Idea #4.  Student will deploy Web Site on Raspberry Pi server. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to enable communications between clients and servers.  HTTP methods GET is used to request data, HTTP POST is used to update data.  Internet routing and user access considerations should be considered in design.
Big Idea #5.  Consider impact of your system in things like Night at the Museum or other opportunities to use this project to bolster your personal and team profile.  Also, consider credits to others that have assisted in producing your work.
